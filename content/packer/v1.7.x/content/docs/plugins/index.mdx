# Packer Plugins

Packer Plugins allow new functionality to be added to Packer without modifying
the core source code. **Packer plugins** are able to add new components to
Packer, such as **builders**, **provisioners**, **post-processors**, and **data
sources**.

This page documents how to install plugins. You can find a list of available
plugins in the [Plugins section](/plugins).

If you're interested in developing plugins, see the [developing
plugins](/docs/plugins/creation#developing-plugins) page.

If you're a plugin maintainer interested in supporting HCP Packer, see the [HCP
support](/docs/plugins/hcp-support) page.
