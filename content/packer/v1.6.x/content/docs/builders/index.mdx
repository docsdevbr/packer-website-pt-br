# Builders

Builders are responsible for creating machines and generating images from them
for various platforms. For example, there are separate builders for EC2,
VMware, VirtualBox, etc. Packer comes with many builders by default, and can
also be extended to add new builders.

To learn more about an individual builder, choose it from the sidebar. Each
builder has its own configuration options and parameters.
