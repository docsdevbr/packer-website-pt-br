# Oracle Builder

Packer is able to create custom images on both Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Classic Compute. Packer comes with builders
designed to support both platforms. Please choose the one that's right for you:

- [oracle-classic](/docs/builders/oracle-classic) - Create custom images
  in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Classic Compute by launching a source
  instance and creating an image list from a snapshot of it after
  provisioning.

- [oracle-oci](/docs/builders/oracle-oci) - Create custom images in
  Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) by launching a base instance and creating
  an image from it after provisioning.
