# `substr` Function

`substr` extracts a substring from a given string by offset and length.

```hcl
substr(string, offset, length)
```

## Examples

```shell-session
> substr("hello world", 1, 4)
ello
```

The offset and length are both counted in _unicode characters_ rather than
bytes:

```shell-session
> substr("ğŸ¤”ğŸ¤·", 0, 1)
ğŸ¤”
```
