# `chomp` Function

`chomp` removes newline characters at the end of a string.

This can be useful if, for example, the string was read from a file that has
a newline character at the end.

## Examples

```shell-session
> chomp("hello\n")
hello
> chomp("hello\r\n")
hello
> chomp("hello\n\n")
hello
```
