# `log` Function

`log` returns the logarithm of a given number in a given base.

```hcl
log(number, base)
```

## Examples

```shell-session
> log(50, 10)
1.6989700043360185
> log(16, 2)
4
```

`log` and `ceil` can be used together to find the minimum number of binary
digits required to represent a given number of distinct values:

```shell-session
> ceil(log(15, 2))
4
> ceil(log(16, 2))
4
> ceil(log(17, 2))
5
```
