# `min` Function

`min` takes one or more numbers and returns the smallest number from the set.

## Examples

```shell-session
> min(12, 54, 3)
3
```

If the numbers are in a list or set value, use `...` to expand the collection
to individual arguments:

```shell-session
> min([12, 54, 3]...)
3
```
